# E07a-Particles
Playing with particles and emitters

This is an opportunity for you to play with some particles. For this assignment, I used particles to simulate rain. I use the asset "trace_02" for the rain drops, which can be found in the assets folder. When you click left on your mouse, you will see the "rain" fall!
